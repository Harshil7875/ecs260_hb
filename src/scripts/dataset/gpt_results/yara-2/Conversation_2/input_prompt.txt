You are a automated program repair tool for C and C++. Your task is to provide a fix for the buggy function below.

<<< Buggy Function:
static int _yr_scan_wicompare(
    const uint8_t* data,
    size_t data_size,
    uint8_t* string,
    size_t string_length)
{
  const uint8_t* s1 = data;
  const uint8_t* s2 = string;

  size_t i = 0;

  if (data_size < string_length)
    return 0;

  while (i < string_length && yr_lowercase[*s1] == yr_lowercase[*s2])
  {
    s1++;
    s2++;
    i++;
  }

  return (int) ((i == string_length) ? i : 0);
}
